# VLA-252A: A Revolutionary Passive Graphic Equalizer Prototype
VLA-252A is an open-source project aimed at creating a digital model of the iconic Langevin EQ252A, one of the earliest and most sought-after analog graphic EQs in history. Our goal is to provide a modern, affordable, and efficient solution for replicating the timeless sound of the Langevin EQ252A and revolutionizing the way we approach equalization in the digital age.

## Why VLA-252A?
The Langevin EQ252A is a legendary graphic equalizer that has been used in countless recordings for decades. However, due to its rarity and cost, it is out of reach for most musicians, engineers, and hobbyists. We believe that everyone should have access to this classic sound, regardless of their budget or location.

To achieve this goal, we are using Wave Digital Filters to create a digital model of the Langevin EQ252A. This approach allows us to emulate the unique characteristics of the EQ252A's passive circuitry, such as its smooth curves, phase response, and harmonic distortion, while also providing the flexibility, precision, and recallability of digital processing.

## How does VLA-252A work?
VLA-252A is a standalone application that can be run on any computer or device that supports VST, AU, or AAX plugins. It works by processing audio signals through a series of fixed-frequency bands, each with its own gain control and bypass switch. The fixed frequencies are carefully chosen to provide a useful range of EQ curves and to avoid overlap or gaps between adjacent bands.

The user interface of VLA-252A is designed to be intuitive, responsive, and customizable. It features a graph display of the EQ curve, a spectrum analyzer, a level meter, and a set of controls for adjusting the gain, bypass, and Q factor of each band. The user can also save and recall presets, automate parameters, and use MIDI controllers to control the EQ in real-time.

## How can I use VLA-252A?
VLA-252A is released under the GPL license, which means that it is free and open-source software. You can download the latest version of VLA-252A from the project's GitHub repository.
