  <h2>Background</h2>
  <h3>Langevin 252A Equalizer</h3>
  <p>The Langevin 252A Equalizer is an iconic analog equalizer known for its exceptional sound quality and versatility. It features seven bands, each with a fixed frequency center and a variable gain control, allowing for precise equalization across the audio spectrum.</p>
  <p>The EQ 252A's analog circuitry provides warmth, color, and depth to audio signals, contributing to its unique sonic characteristics.</p>

  <h3>Wave Digital Filters</h3>
  <p>Wave Digital Filters (WDFs) are a digital signal processing technique used to model and emulate analog audio circuits. They accurately simulate the behavior of analog components in the digital domain by using wave variables to represent voltages and currents in the circuit.</p>
  <p>WDFs are employed in this software project to faithfully reproduce the sonic qualities and tonal characteristics of the Langevin 252A equalizer, providing users with a highly realistic and versatile equalization tool.</p>
